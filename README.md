# RPI RunningManBareMetal

This is a "bare-metal" program for the raspberry pi
that has an animation of a stick figure man running across 
the screen.

Bare-metal means that there is no Operating System (such as Linux)
is running on the raspberry pi. The program is interfacing with the hardware
directly using the documented register interfaces.

The code in this repository is a modified version  of the 
[code found in part15](https://github.com/rockytriton/LLD/tree/main/rpi_bm/part15) of the 
[Low Level Devel - Paspberry Pi Bare Metal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVxiWMqQvhg9FCteL7I0aohj1_YiUx1x8)
Youtube series.

The above Youtube series references Sergey Matyukevich's tutorial
which teaches how to create a simple operating system (OS) kernel from
scratch.
